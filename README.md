🩸 Blood Donation Management System

The Blood Donation Management System is a SQL-based, database-driven application designed to manage and streamline blood donation processes for hospitals, blood banks, and donors. It ensures data integrity, efficient retrieval, and improved coordination between key stakeholders in healthcare.

📂 Database Design

12 interconnected tables covering:

Users

Donors

Donations

Test Results

Blood Banks

Inventories

Hospitals

Requests

Events

Volunteers

Enforces primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and normalization to reduce redundancy and maintain consistency.

⚡ Key Functionalities

Donor Management → Track and manage donor records, donation history.

Blood Bank & Inventory Management → Monitor available units, update stock in real-time.

Hospital Requests → Record and fulfill hospital blood requests efficiently.

Event & Volunteer Management → Organize and track blood donation drives.

Data Integrity & Security → Enforce NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK constraints.

🛠️ SQL Features

DDL → CREATE, ALTER, DROP for schema design.

DML → INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for data operations.

DQL → SELECT queries for insights (donor frequency, blood stock, donation success rates).

📊 Advanced Features

CTEs → Donation summaries and averages.

Views → Preprocessed data for machine learning and analysis.

Analytics → Donor health analysis, running totals, and success rate evaluation.

✅ Impact

This system improves healthcare logistics by:

Reducing human error

Enhancing donor-hospital coordination
