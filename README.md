#Blood Donation Management System

The Blood Donation Management System is a database-driven application designed to manage and streamline blood donation processes for hospitals, blood banks, and donors. It ensures data integrity, efficient retrieval, and improved coordination between key stakeholders in healthcare.

The system incorporates 12 interconnected tables covering users, donors, donations, test results, blood banks, inventories, hospitals, requests, events, and volunteers. It enforces proper primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and normalization to minimize redundancy and maintain consistency.

Key functionalities include:

Donor Management – Maintain accurate donor records, track donations, and retrieve histories.

Blood Bank & Inventory Management – Monitor available blood units and update stock levels in real time.

Hospital Requests – Record and fulfill blood requests efficiently.

Event & Volunteer Management – Organize and track blood donation drives and participants.

Data Integrity & Security – Enforce constraints such as NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK.

The project demonstrates the use of SQL commands:

DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) for schema design.

DML (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) for data management.

DQL (SELECT queries) for retrieving insights like donor frequency, blood stock availability, and donation success rates.

Advanced features include complex queries for analytics, such as calculating donation averages with CTEs, creating views for machine learning, and analyzing donor health data.

✅ Impact: This system improves healthcare logistics by reducing human error, enhancing donor-hospital coordination, and ensuring blood availability during emergencies.
